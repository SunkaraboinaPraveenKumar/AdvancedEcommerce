SCSS Usage
This project utilizes SCSS for styling. To use SCSS, you will typically follow these steps:

Create SCSS files: Create .scss files in your src directory or a dedicated styles directory.

Import SCSS in your components: Import the SCSS files directly into your React components. For example:

javascript
Copy code
import './styles/main.scss';
Compile SCSS: Vite handles SCSS compilation out of the box, so there is no additional setup required. Just make sure your SCSS files are correctly referenced in your components.
